      <h3><strong>Jessi Anderson</strong></h3>
      <p>
        My name is Jessi Anderson, and I am a senior at Arizona State University pursuing a BS in
        Business Entrepreneurship with a certificate in Digital Business Innovation. After graduation,
        my dream is to open a start-up coffee shop that blends the perfect vibe of coziness and
        productivity, creating a space where people from all backgrounds can come together to connect,
        study, or simply enjoy the atmosphere. Jessi’s Coffee Co. will serve a variety of specialty
        drinks alongside classic coffee favorites, complemented by fresh baked goods and breakfast
        items. With something for everyone, my goal is to create not just a coffee shop, but a sanctuary.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in a small town in Washington called North Bend. I went to college in
        Arizona to escape the constant rain and to work toward my dream of becoming an entrepreneur.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Why a coffee shop?</strong></h3>
      <p>
        During my last two years of high school, I was part of a program called Running Start, which allowed me
        to earn both high school and college credits by taking classes at a nearby community college. Almost every
        day after class, I would stop at a coffee shop just off campus for a drink, a snack, and a place to do homework.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, I looked around and realized something special: everyone in that shop was there for completely different
        reasons. A group was planning a wedding, someone was meeting with higher-ups about a product launch, a couple looked
        like they were on a first date, and one person was quietly reading a book. I thought, how amazing that all these people,
        with such different lives, chose to be in the same space at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        That moment sparked my dream of opening a coffee shop where people feel comfortable and create meaningful experiences
        of their own. Since then, I’ve been working toward this goal: I became a barista, gained three years of hands-on
        experience, and committed myself to business school with this vision in mind every single day. I’m excited to take
        the next step and bring this startup to life.
